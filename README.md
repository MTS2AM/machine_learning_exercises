# machine_learning_exercises
Just some training exercises from the data science masterclass (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass), some of the models could be actually improved by tuning the hyperparameters (which I will do it after the course ).

Note: All the files are in jupyter ( since is the most common in data science :D )
